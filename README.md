what is this all about?
=======================

while playing CTFs we ran always into the sames problems: 
submitting captured flags! rather everyone hacked his or her 
own submitscript, bombing the gameserver with simultanious 
connections and tons of old and already submitted flags.

i think we all agree that this is not the way it's meand to be 
played...
