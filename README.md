What is this all about?
=======================

While playing CTFs we ran always into the same problem: 
submitting captured flags! Until now everyone hacked his or
her own submitscript, bombing the gameserver with simultanious 
connections and tons of old and already submitted flags.

I think we all agree that this is not the way it's meant to be 
played...
